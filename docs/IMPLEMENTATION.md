# Implementation evidence

The [ADR](adr/0001-versioned-public-wiki.md) owns requirements. This file tracks
delivery evidence and unfinished work; an implemented stage does not prove the
complete product.

## Boundaries and performance

- The parent decompiler owns input stability, source/catalog capture and Git diff.
  Its command invokes the wiki only after successful capture or verified reuse.
- `wikibuild/source.py` streams selected immutable Git blobs through one process.
  Adapters own field selection and interpretation. No raw catalog copy or public
  source tree is an intermediate wiki artifact.
- `wikibuild/exceptions.py` groups unsupported cases by rule/pattern, with counts
  and bounded examples. Execution failures propagate separately.
- Extraction results retain source hashes separately from semantic content hashes.
  Reuse checks include inputs, adapter/schema versions and required output hashes.
  New input discovery must run even when existing inputs are unchanged.
- Topic ownership stays in `project.json`. Identity, rendering, local release and
  publication have separate owners. Readers consume immutable release manifests;
  the hub points to a release only after every referenced target verifies.
- Use streaming and small selected-record joins first. Add SQLite only if measured
  access patterns justify it. Avoid parallel tasks that duplicate large resident
  catalogs; bounded concurrency suits independent decompiler and deployment jobs.

## Remaining completion gates

- Integrate the decompile entrypoint, verified capture reuse, durable run receipts,
  separate failure reports and final unresolved-content report.
- Extract and independently validate every registered gameplay topic. Account for
  source objects locally without copying the whole index into wiki content.
- Implement evidence-based identity reconciliation, explicit ambiguity, removals,
  semantic revision reuse and dependency-based verification across captured builds.
- Render readable grouped pages, search, version selection, provenance, historical
  links, authored-claim checks and useful external backlinks.
- Coordinate child commits and immutable releases with interrupted-run recovery,
  writer exclusion, unknown-file protection and failure-before-promotion checks.
- Create the declared public repositories, provision Pages, validate target content
  and promote the hub last. Prove retry, rollback and automatic capacity allocation.
- Run real initial generation and an unchanged repeat; measure time, bytes read,
  output size and peak memory. Exercise changed/new/removed/unsupported records and
  tool corrections, using real builds and focused fixtures for unavailable cases.
- Review public content for source fidelity and private-input exclusion, verify
  browser behavior and remote state, and audit every ADR acceptance requirement.

## Current evidence

- The item/loot extraction command produced 944 items, 29 loot tags, 51 loot tables
  and 862 loot sources from snapshot `build-25548639-9d77a0415918`. It read
  14,170,904 source bytes and produced 2,377,192 bytes of selected observations.
  An unchanged repeat read zero source bytes and reused hash-validated output.
  These counts cover the implemented contracts, not the complete game wiki.
- `py -3 tools/check_extraction.py` independently checked raw serialized records:
  78 assertions across 12 sampled observations covering all four implemented kinds.
- Extraction tests cover unknown/new/nested fields, unsupported source classes,
  reappearing dependencies, immutable reads, missing input, modified output,
  failure before pointer promotion and unchanged/irrelevant-change reuse.
- A real refresh created source commit `c0582635a6ecbe8dd85ed2271a3ab5f424d618ad`.
  Its only change was the generator hash. The immediate repeat verified installed
  hashes and skipped catalog export and all 197 assembly decompilations, retaining
  that commit and a clean source tree. Extraction from the new snapshot passed the
  same independent checks and reused identical observation bytes.
- The wiki suite passed 38 tests; the parent catalog suite passed 20 tests with the
  configured isolated Python dependencies. The mod solution built with zero warnings
  and zero errors. Map, registry, lock, documentation links and diff checks passed.
- Public repositories, release generation and the remaining topics have not been
  implemented yet. No game files or third-party plugins were changed.

## Deferred classifier experiments

No classifier is implemented. Record evidence-backed candidates here as adapters
encounter them, including examples, expected labels, error impact, held-out test
data and accuracy/cost comparison with rules and manual review.

One candidate is reader-facing subcategory assignment for items whose existing
`Icon_Info._Tag` is broad: for example, `BuildMat` covers internally named building
shapes and materials. A classifier could propose labels from the English item
name and selected tags when explicit game enums/relationships do not decide them.
Test on manually labeled held-out items from different builds, measuring precision,
abstention, repeatability, memory and latency. Wrong labels affect navigation;
they must never alter extracted facts, canonical identities or declared ownership.
